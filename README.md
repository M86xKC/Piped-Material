An alternative to an alternative YouTube frontend which is efficient by design.

Piped-redesign is an attempt to redesign Piped to be more space-efficient, rational and good-looking.

As a byproduct, the code is also much cleaner, dysfunctional patterns and paradigms have been replaced with clean, beautiful code :).
