Piped-Material is a fork of [Piped](https://github.com/TeamPiped/piped), an alternative client to YouTube. I have tried to improve the performance, the design and efficiency.

There are a few things that PM does better, like watch history tracking, but it's feature complete in almost all places.

As a byproduct, the code is also much cleaner, dysfunctional patterns and paradigms have been replaced with clean, beautiful code :).

Production instances are updated infrequently, and do not include features that are introduced recently without extensive testing.
